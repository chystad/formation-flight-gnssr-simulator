# GNSS_R_Formation_Simulator
This repo will analyze the long-term mission energy consumption required to maintain a dual satellite formation and provide mission-critical pointing. This work is part of Christoffer D. Hystad's Master's Thesis at NTNU and will build on the previous work done in the Specialization Project during the prior semester.
